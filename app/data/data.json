      "summary": "This is a 5 part story about (my side project and attempted full time project in 2014) 'JS Bin' and the abuse that it's suffered over the last 7 years of being an open project. The stories include tales of spam, abuse from registered users and the impact on personal life, dealing with the process of taking money, and the pain (oh...the pain) and finally police involvement (from a casual planned DDoS, child pornography and terrorism). In each section, I've tried to end on a positive note (but it's not terribly technical) even though the actual content is fairly negative and dark at times. It's an extremely personal story, but there's way too much 'hey, my project is awesome, who want's a high-five?!' - this is very much the antidote!",
